#
#                   set MERGE_INI = <path to this file>
#
#           if not set, then the first "merge.ini" file found in:
#                  - the current directory of current drive
#                  - the directories in the PATH environment
#                    variable are checked in order. (Windows only)
#                  - the root directory of the current drive (Windows only)
#
#          For MERGECOM_3_PROFILE, MERGECOM_3_SERVICES, and 
#          MERGECOM_3_APPLICATIONS; one environment variable can be 
#          used at the beginning of the declaration to specify the file's path.
#          EXAMPLE:   MC3CONFIGDIR  = /usr/merge/mergecom3 
#                     MERGECOM_3_PROFILE      = $(MC3CONFIGDIR)/mergecom.pro
#                     MERGECOM_3_SERVICES     = $(MC3CONFIGDIR)/mergecom.srv
#                     MERGECOM_3_APPLICATIONS = $(MC3CONFIGDIR)/mergecom.app
#
#                     or percent signs may be used for the environment variable:
#                     MERGECOM_3_PROFILE      = %MC3CONFIGDIR%\mergecom.pro
#                     MERGECOM_3_SERVICES     = %MC3CONFIGDIR%\mergecom.srv
#                     MERGECOM_3_APPLICATIONS = %MC3CONFIGDIR%\mergecom.app
#
#        
#          A special macro "MC3INIDIR" is used to represents the directory where
#          "merge.ini" is. It's used like the environment variable with the 
#          difference that it's automatically resolved and does not need to be set.          
#          If MERGECOM_3_PROFILE, MERGECOM_3_SERVICES or MERGECOM_3_APPLICATIONS
#          contain relative paths and use "MC3INIDIR", the toolkit considers the 
#          path relative to the location of the "merge.ini" file.
#          EXAMPLE: 
#                     MERGECOM_3_PROFILE      = $(MC3INIDIR)../config/mergecom.pro
#                     MERGECOM_3_SERVICES     = $(MC3INIDIR)../config/mergecom.srv
#                     MERGECOM_3_APPLICATIONS = $(MC3INIDIR)../config/mergecom.app
#
#                     or percent signs may be used:
#                     MERGECOM_3_PROFILE      = %MC3INIDIR%..\config\mergecom.pro
#                     MERGECOM_3_SERVICES     = %MC3INIDIR%..\config\mergecom.srv
#                     MERGECOM_3_APPLICATIONS = %MC3INIDIR%..\config\mergecom.app

# MESSAGE LOG TRACE LEVELS
#============================================================================
# Choices: One or more of OFF, File, Screen, Memory
#
# Note:  The trace level logging levels can seriously degrade tool kit
# performance.  In particular, the T2, T7 and T9 levels affect performance.
# these trace levels should not be left on in normal operation.
#
# Logging Level Description:
#
# Error:  This level logs error messages.  These messages mainly occur
#         when a network failure occurs, or when reading in or writting
#         objects.
#
# Warning: This level logs warning messages.
#
# Information: This level logs informational messages.
#
# T1: not used
#
# T2: This level logs the entire contents of messages sent or received
#     over the network.  The format is similar to MC_List_Message's output.
#
# T3: This level logs information related to association negotiation.
#
# T4: This level logs information when incoming associations are being
#     automatically rejected.
#
# T5: This level logs information when a message is validated with the 
#     MC_Validate_Message, MC_Validate_File, or MC_Validate_Attribute
#     functions.
#
# T6: This level logs the contents of the tool kit's configuration files
#     when the library is initialized.
#
# T7: This level logs the contents of a the command elements (group 0)
#     for received and sent mesages.
#
# T8: This level logs "warning" messages related to streaming in or out
#     messages and files.
#
# T9: This level logs information about PDUs sent or received by the 
#     library.
#
